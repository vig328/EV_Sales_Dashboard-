# 4. Key Takeaways
BEVs dominate the EV market share (~78%).

Tesla is the market leader by a large margin.

Rapid growth post-2010 shows increasing EV adoption trends.

CAFV eligibility unknown for ~46% of vehicles â€” possible data quality issue.

Certain states likely have higher adoption (map suggests concentration in specific regions).

Average electric range is still under 70 miles, showing potential for battery improvements.

# 5. How This Can Be Used
Policy Makers: Identify states needing more EV infrastructure.

Car Manufacturers: Spot competitive opportunities in underrepresented markets.

EV Charging Companies: Focus on states/years with high growth for station installation.

Environmental Agencies: Track CAFV program adoption.
